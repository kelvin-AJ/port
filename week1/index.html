            <span class="emph">Build Mobile First </span><br />
            <span class="emph_2">Advantages:</span>
            Provides best experience across many device
            Address contrsints of mobile not only screensize but also bandwidth

            REMEMBER: Start small and scale up. This makes you focus more on content and functionality. This make things a LOT more easier for me(The designer) and the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="emph">Improve mobile experience by understanding users </span><br />
            Don't make users hunt for what they want. Provide what they came for as quickly as possible. Also be sure to get the users what they need as soon as possible(The less steps the user has to go through, the better).

            <span class="emph_2">Remember:</span>
            Reachability ,Network and speed matter. Reduce images, If you do need to reduce images (SVG/ WEBFonts are recommended). Optimize and Minify CSS and JS.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class="emph">Better Mobile experince with strategic menu designs</span><br /> 
            Location of the menu icon on moblie should be close to the thumb. Menu button design should also be intuitive. Apparently many people don't like hamburgers. Buttons should look like buttons and not just text.

        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="emph">Better mobile experience with mobile friendly forms</span><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Larger input fields</li>
                <li>Ditch the labels. Use placeholders instead and float labels so users don't forget what they are filling out.</li>
                <li>Don't ask unnecessary questions. Less input fields.
                If you do need more information. emply pagination. break down form into several sections. Don't forget to show the users their progress so they don't have to wonder how much stuff they have to fill.</li>
                <li>Enable auto-complete.</li>
                <li>Show passwords by default. Allow users toggle view or not.
                Users forgetting passwords causes a lot of support cost
                .</li>
                <li>When taking numbers, make sure the keyboard is the right one.</li>
                <li>Use anchor tags for phone numbers so the user can make the call just by tapping.</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="emph_2">Remember:</span>Reduce cognitive load
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="emph">Better mobile advertising experience</span><br />
