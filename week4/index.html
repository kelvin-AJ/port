            <ul class="notes-list" id="click">
                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Forms</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The <span class="emph_4">span</span> attribute is the URL where the form data would be submitted
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We can access form element by using <span class="emph_4">document.forms</span> which returns an HTML collection of all forms in the document. we can also use <span class="emph_4">document.<span class="method">getElementsByTagname</span>(<span class="string">"form"</span>)[0]</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            we can use the <span class="emph_4">name</span> attribute to identify a form. We can do this with both dot "." and bracket "[]" notation. Using the bracket notation is more advised to avoid selection form properties.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>the <span class="emph_4">elements</span> method returns an HTML collection of all elements contained in the form.
                        </li> 

                        <li>We can also access the form controls using their <span class="emph_4">name</span> attributes as if it was a property of the form object. so if set the name attribute of a first Name input to <span class="emph_4">firstName</span>, we can access it like <span class="emph_4">form.firstName</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="emph_4">form.submit()</span> would submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by using an actual button or an input type of submit.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                        <span class="emph_4">form.reset()</span> resets all form controls back to their initial values. a button type with the attribute of <span class="emph_4">reset</span> does the same thing. Reset buttons are generally NOT adviced. You don't want the users to wipe out all the data they entered when it's not yet saved.
                        </li>
                        <li>form.action sets the action attribute of a form.
                        (form events in console)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>
                    <ol>
