                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Forms</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The <span class="emph_4">span</span> attribute is the URL where the form data would be submitted
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We can access form element by using <span class="emph_4">document.forms</span> which returns an HTML collection of all forms in the document. we can also use <span class="emph_4">document.<span class="method">getElementsByTagname</span>(<span class="string">"form"</span>)[0]</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            we can use the <span class="emph_4">name</span> attribute to identify a form. We can do this with both dot "." and bracket "[]" notation. Using the bracket notation is more advised to avoid selection form properties.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>the <span class="emph_4">elements</span> method returns an HTML collection of all elements contained in the form.
                        </li> 

                        <li>We can also access the form controls using their <span class="emph_4">name</span> attributes as if it was a property of the form object. so if set the name attribute of a first Name input to <span class="emph_4">firstName</span>, we can access it like <span class="emph_4">form.firstName</span>
                        </li>
                        <li><span class="emph_4">form.submit()</span> would submit the form automatically. A form can be submitted manually by using an actual button or an input type of submit.
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                        <span class="emph_4">form.reset()</span> resets all form controls back to their initial values. a button type with the attribute of <span class="emph_4">reset</span> does the same thing. Reset buttons are generally NOT adviced. You don't want the users to wipe out all the data they entered when it's not yet saved.
                        </li>
                        <li>form.action sets the action attribute of a form.
                        (form events in console)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</span>
                    <ol>
                        
                        <li>Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world.</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation involves keeping all programming logic hidden(encapsulated) in an object and then providing methods to the users without them having to understand how it works.</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism: various objects can share the same methods and can override those methods based on what they do. How the on button for a light bulb turns the light on and another on the button for a fan would get it to spin. "same method, different implementation".</li>
                        <li>Inheritance provides us be the ability to take an object that already exists then inherit all its methods and properties as if they were defined by the new object, then add methods and properties to it.</li>
                        <li>Classes are like a blueprint for creating objects.</li>
                        <li>The constructor function returns the object we want to create.</li>
                        <li>We create instances of constructor functions with the following syntax</li>
                        <li>this keyword represents the object that is returned.</li>
                        <li>ES6 class declaration syntax does the same thing as a constructor function but looks similar to classes in class-based programming languages</li>
                        <li>all code in a class definition is implicitly in strict mode, so doesn't need the 'use strict' statement at the start of the file.</li>
                        <li>This means that every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class.</li>
                        <li>It is impossible to overwrite the prototype by assigning it to a new object literal if class declarations are used. We can overwrite prototypes if constructor functions are used. Because of the danger that comes with reassigning prototypes, class declarations are recommended.</li>
                        <li>Properties can be reassigned.</li>
                        <li>When a property or a method is called, The engine would check if that object has that method. If it doesn't, it will look it up by 'going up the prototype chain until it finds it. </li>
                        <li>By default, JavaScript object methods are public. They can be changed externally simply by reassigning. We use getters and setters to access and modify private properties.</li>
                        <li> enumerable object properties show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through that object’s properties.</li>
                        <li> A class can inherit from another class using the 'extends' keyword in a class declaration.</li>
                        <li>When a method is called on a primitive value, JavaScript creates a wrapper object for the primitive, which converts it into an object and then calls the method on the object.</li>
                        <li>monkey-patching involves adding our own methods to the prototype of inbuilt objects. It should be avoided because it can cause unexpected behavior in javascript. A way to avoid monkey-patching is by using 'extends' so you inherit all methods of that inbuilt objects.</li>
                        <li>Instead of using assignment, we can add properties to an object using the Object.defineProperty() method so we can explicitly set it's property descriptor</li>
                        <li> A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance.</li>
                        <li>object methods returning 'this' make it easy to chain methods.</li>
                        <li>We can borrow methods by using the call method. This lets us assign the 'this' keyword to the object we pass in as the parameter.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Modular JavaScript</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules</li>
                        <li>"Keeping code modular helps to make it more loosely coupled and interchangeable, meaning you can easily swap one module for another without affecting other parts of a project."</li>
                        <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode.</li>
                        <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
                        <li>The value of this in the top level of a module is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Default exports are single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named.</li>
                        <li>Having more than one default export will result in a syntax error.</li>
                        <li>Node.js uses Common Js modules.</li>
                        </ol>
