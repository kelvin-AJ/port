// If a function doesnâ€™t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument;

// Memoization involves the use of a "cache" property assigned to a function to store results whenever the function runs. This is especially useful for functions that take time to run so it saves time by simply returning values already stored for reused arguments.
// IIFE are anonymous functions that are called immediately they are defined

(function(){
    const temp = 'World';

// Placing any code that uses any temporary variables inside an IIFE will ensure itâ€™s only available while the IIFE is invoked, then it will disappear. This reduces the chances of the global namespace being polluted.

// Async functions
// Async functions were added to the ES2017 specification. These functions are preceded by the async keyword and allow you to write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous.

// Closures
// A closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function or "it's birthplace" even after it has been reassigned.

// Pure functions adhere to the following rules: <ol><li>The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program.</li> <li> There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data. </li><li>Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always return the same result.</li></ol>

// Higher-Orde Functions are functions that accept other functions as arguments and/or returns another function.

// Curring involves nesting functions into other functions such that the inititial function can take one parameter and then return a function that takes another and the chain can go on until all parameter are available at the last function.This "function call chaining" is useful when other needed parameter are ot readily available.
