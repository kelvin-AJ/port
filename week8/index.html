                    <span class="emph">CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</span>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The CSS3 <span class="emph_4">transform</span> property lets us translate, scale and/or skew any element on the webpage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="emph_4">transform: <span class="method">translate</span>(-10px, -10px)</span> :<br>
                            <div class="testdiv translate">hover to translate</div>
                            To move elements vertically or horizontally, we use the <span class="emph_4">translateX</span> or <span class="emph_4">translateY</span> property. Transform don't work on inline elements
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="emph_4">transform: <span class="method">scale</span>(0.8, 1.5)</span> :<br>
                            <div class="testdiv scale">hover to scale</div>
                            We can alse use <span class="emph_4">scaleX</span> and <span class="emph_4">scaleY</span> to scale horizontally or vertically.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Declaring a second transform to the same element would overwrite the first. To add multiple transform attributes, separate attibutes with a space.
                        </li>
                        <li>Transforming does not cause a reflow</li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="emph_4">transform: <span class="method">rotate</span>(30deg)</span> :<br>
                            <div class="testdiv rotate">hover to rotate</div>
                            rotation happens clockwise.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="emph_4">transform: <span class="method">skew</span>(-30deg, -10deg)</span> :<br>
                            <div class="testdiv skew">hover to skew</div>
                        </li>
                        <li>we can manipulate the origin of our transform using the <span class="emph_4">tranform-origin</span> property. this is especially useful for shapes like cicles or ellipses that look the same if their center of roation is at their center.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The order fo transform functions matter, The effect is applied one after the other. Almost like one function returns a new version of that element that has been transformed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CSS Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time.
                            The <span class="emph_4">transition-property</span> property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned. The <span class="emph_4">transition-duration</span> property sets how long the transition will take.
                            The <span class="emph_4">transition-timing-function</span> lets you control the pace of the transition in more detail. 
                        </li>
                        <li>We cal have mulitple transition propertues by separating them with commas. </li>
                        <li>Generally, it is best to use CSS for simple-state changes in a mobile environment. But it's still better to employ JavaScript for intricate, stateful UIs, and when you do, you'll likely want to use a JavaScript animation library to help with manageability and performance.</li>
                        <li>
                            Animated element using keyframes:<br>
                            <div class="moving-circle"></div>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <span class="emph_4">animation-fill-mode</span> property defines what happens before the first animation iteration begins and after the last animation iteration concludes
                        </li>
                        <li>When using the shorthand property, animation names that are also animation property key term such as forwards, running, or alternate should not be used.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Canvas, SVG and Drag and Drop</span>
                    <span class="emph_2">Canvas Element 1:</span>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
                        Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.
                    </canvas>
                    <span class="emph_2">Canvas Element 2:</span>
                    <canvas id="myCanvas2" class="myCanvas" width="200" height="200">
                        Sorry! Your browser doesn't support Canvas.
                    </canvas>
                    <button name="saveButton" id="saveButton">Save Drawings</button>
                    <ul>
                    <li>We can also use <span class="emph_4">canvas</span> to manipulate images and videos</li>
                    <li>
                        "A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. The canvas doesn't create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers."
                    </li>
                    <li>SVG stands for scalable vector graphics. They do not diminish in quality even as we blow them up or shrink them unlike bitmap images. SVG Example:</li>
                    <li>
                        <img src="../images/drawing.svg" alt="night" width="300px">
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "The <span class="emph_4">viewBox</span> attribute defines the starting location, width, and height of the SVG image."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Canvas is faster than SVG but is not accessible by the DOM. Canvas is in 'immediate' mode while SVG is in 'retained' mode.
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="emph">Drag and Drop</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
